# Exploring Loan Data Patterns
## by Aliscia Boyd


## Dataset: Loan Data from Prosper

> In this project I examine a dataset containing the loan information of customers of San Francisco based US company Prosper Loans. This dataset has 105,383 loans with 81 variables regarding each. I decided to keep 38 of those variables for my analysis. Both loan characteristics (amount, monthly payment, loan status, etc.) as well as relevant consumer information (income range, credit score, employment, etc.) are included within.


## Summary of Findings

After splitting the data into four groups according to Homeowner vs. Renter and Good Debt Ratio vs. Bad Debt Ratio, I gained a number of insights regarding how debt and homeownership can affect consumer loans.


## Key Insights

> Both homeowners and renters with bad debt ratios tend to be current on their loans more than their good ratio counterparts.

> Homeowners with good debt ratios default on their loans the least, while homeowners with bad debt ratios default the most, even more than all renters.

> Debt ratio does not have any significant statistical correlation, positive (>.50) or negative (<-.50), with any other loan characteristic in any of the four groups.

> For all ratio groups, loans of a lesser amount typically have more investors than higher value loans. This is true across all score groups. I found this to be very interesting, since I assumed that the opposite would be true.

> For all groups, a credit score of around 750 or higher seems to be the point where a noticeable rise in Propser score is seen. Loan amounts also seem to correlate positively with both Prosper score and upper credit range. So consumers with higher Prosper scores and upper credit limits are seemingly approved for bigger loans.
